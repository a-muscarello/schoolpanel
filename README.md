Ruby Admin Panel Project

Overview: Designing a fullstack admin panel, with a single user with options for adding, editing, updating and deleting users. 

Utilizes: Ruby - Rails, Rakefile ActiveRecord PostgreSQL Bootstrap

Work scope: Created wireframe for the layout. Pseudo coded the necessary steps required to complete the project. Kept adding/deleting as necessary, throughout the project. Created a Github page. Started with creating the necessary files, did a bundle install and created the databases for the project. Update the databases with the necessary fields required for the project. Created the necessary routes. Created a seeds file for input materials for the database. Created a delete function via Ajax call. Tested that the website works as required. Finalized a design that would fit with the theme of the project - an admin panel, in this case. Used Bootstrap for layout and styling. Continued to commit to the Github page throughout the duration. Deployed on Heroku.

Features: Bootstrap layout.
